# Visualize-It

**Visualize-It** is an interactive tool designed to dynamically visualize various sorting algorithms and the Gradient Descent optimization technique. This tool helps users understand algorithmic behavior through engaging visual representations and real-time performance metrics.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Observe the sorting process and optimization steps in real-time.
- **Performance Metrics**: View metrics such as iterations, comparisons, swaps, and cost function minimization.
- **User Interaction**: Select different sorting algorithms and restart the simulation with a button click.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the application, with integration of the Materialize framework for enhanced UI components.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic and interactivity of the visualizations.
- **Materialize**: A CSS framework that provides modern UI components.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/visualize-it.git
    ```

2. **Open `index.html`**:
    - Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start using the tool.

## How to Use

1. **Choose a Sorting Algorithm**:
   - Navigate to the Sorting Algorithm section.
   - Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu to visualize its sorting process.

2. **Restart the Simulation**:
   - Click the "Restart" button to reset the simulation and start fresh.

3. **View Metrics**:
   - Metrics such as iterations, comparisons, and swaps will be displayed in real-time during the simulation.

4. **Gradient Descent**:
   - Navigate to the Gradient Descent section to visualize the optimization process.

## Algorithms Included

- **Bubble Sort**: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: Finds the smallest (or largest) element and places it in its correct position.
- **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Cocktail Shaker Sort**: A variation of bubble sort that sorts in both directions.
- **Heap Sort**: Utilizes a heap data structure to sort elements.
- **Quick Sort**: Uses divide-and-conquer by selecting a pivot and partitioning the array.
- **Merge Sort**: Recursively divides and merges sorted subarrays.

## Notes

- If the simulation freezes, please refresh the page.
